The Product idea 

 

The software product that I have decided to use for my software product is a dating app. The reason that I chose the dating app us because I never created one before and would like to challenge myself by doing one. 

During my time in coding the landing page I went through multiple different ideas for the name of the dating app. I knew this was an important part because I knew that a good name for my app would be able to catch people's eyes and make them interested in it.  

The name that I chose was find your match, the reason that I chose this name was the most interested and also in a way describes how the app works to the user.  

The potential customers for the dating app you be end users and world be cindered people that are looking for other people to date, for this reason my app neds to create a comfortable environment for these people that use my app in the future to choose people and to talk to them. 

The main functions of the app id for users to find someone to interest them and even to hope full find love. It does this by using a function that allows the user to scroll through people and accept to talk to them through texting if both parties accept. One of the main features of the app us that the user is able to input their hobbies and likes into their description. This allows other users to see what the user likes which helps them chose if they want to communicate or nor. Another feature is that the user is able to choose their preferences in a person. This allows the app to give the user option on people based on their preferences which makes it easier for the user to find their type.
